3.2.Technological  Tools   
3.2.1 XAMPP  - Platform of Web Development
WAMPSERVER are used for the applications that would be executed on the web server. WAMP is a platform of web development, permitting to make functions locally (without connecting to an external server) of the PHP scripts. WAMP is not it self a Software but an environment understanding two servers (a web server APACHE and a database server MYSQL), a PHP Script interpreter as well as SQL Administrator (PHPMYADMIN).

3.2.2.	Apache Server 2.2.11
The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache is web server software notable for playing a key role in the initial growth of the World Wide Web and for today Apache server is PHP, MySQL, WampServer ,XAMPP, and so on. Apache is a server used as local to make our web site. Server is known as a computer or device on a network that manages network resources. 

3.2.3.Programming Languages  and Script Language
PHP 5.3.0
The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor allows web developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP applications are normally found on Linux servers and in conjunction with MySQL databases. PHP is a script language and interpreter that is used primarily for making this web application of Tuition Fees Management System.3.9.6 [12] .


HTML5 is a markup language for structuring and presenting content for the World Wide Web and a core technology of the Internet. It is the fifth revision of the HTML standard (created in 1990 and standardized as HTML4 as of 1997) Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications. In particular, HTML5 adds many new syntactic features. These include the new <video>, <audio> and <canvas> elements, as well as the integration of scalable vector graphics (SVG) content (that replaces the uses of generic <object> tags)  [13] . So  in our project HTML 5  has helped us  to make  the  very clear  design template of  platform  web  application we had  used  in  our  project as   a  background style sheet , this one  it has  a simple linked tabs or  menus related  to their  forms   , each  one  has  their  contents  which  need  to  be  edited  according the  programmer  or   the developer  desire.
  
 
JQuery is a multi-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today. jQuery is free, open source software, licensed under the JQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and web applications [14] .

CSS 3
It stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Style sheet refers to the document itself.
Style sheets have been used for document design for years. They are the technical specifications for a layout, whether print or online. Print designers use style sheets to insure that their designs are printed exactly ,CSS3 are a presentational effect which allow property changes in CSS values, such as those that may be defined to occur smoothly over a specified duration â€“rather than happening instantaneously as is the normal behavior.
Transition effects can be applied to a wide variety of CSS properties, including background-color, width, height, opacity, and many more. The  CSS3 code  in our  implementation had  allowed us  as  web masters  to take  the  measures  and  color  and  the  format you  can  use  in implementing  and  designing  the  web  application [15] .

MYSQL 5.1.36
MySQL is a database system used in this web application. Basically, a MySQL database allows us to create a relational database structure on a web-server somewhere in order to store data or automate procedures. MySQL is what holds all of our tables,  PHP acts as our queries (among other things), and our forms are basically web page with all of this combined, we have create truly spectacular projects on the web. 

Javascript
JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. 
JavaScript is use the Scripts in computer programming, and a script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor. In general, script languages are easier and faster to code than the more structured and compiled languages it is reason why we have preferred this one to carry out this project [ 16] .
